<h2>Sunrise Dolphin Encounter </h2>    
  <p>
<img src="https://cdn.glitch.com/848db645-bd72-4370-8fa6-b79f31669ddc%2Fsunrise%20dolphins.jpeg?v=1596466380676" alt="sunrise dolphins" width="50%" height="25%">On the West Coast of Mauritius, we are lucky enough to have wild dolphins that come near the shore to socialize, rest & play
every morning. We can encounter two types of dolphins: spinner & bottlenose. We normally see one or the other, except if you
are very lucky and meet both species, which happens sometimes!</p>    
<p>We love these sea creatures and our goal is to guide our customers through this lifetime experience; passion and respect are
our priority. The crew will start the excursion with their briefing and give you details about: security, respect of the dolphins,
different spots that you will visit etc…</p>
<p>The departure & arrival is from the L'Estuaire in Black River.
We encourage a very early departure for a peaceful and respectful swimming experience with the mammals; 6:15am in Winter
season & 5:30am in Summer season. We observe and swim with them for approximately 60min to 90min. Then we cruise to
our favorite snorkeling in the Natural Aquarium to see the tropical sea life: clams, fishes, starfish, corals... Last stop of the trip
will be the famous Crystal Rock, in the White Lagoon. A fragile coral formation in the middle of crystal clear water.</p>
<p>For your comfort, snorkelling equipment is provided on board as well as soft beverages and homemade banana bread. Please
bring along your beach towel</p>    
<p>Pssst… Stay calm & positive, the dolphins can feel your energy as they have cerebral & emotional ratios very close to us,
humans!</p>
