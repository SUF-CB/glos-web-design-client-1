Get up close and personal with different kinds of fish. We operate from several locations across Mauritius (Tamarin, Le Morne Brabant etc) and can also arrange a private pickup and drop-off. This shallow undersea walk is safe and does not require any swimming or diving experience and is ideal for the whole family (age 7 and above). By wearing a special dive helmet, you will be able to breathe normally while keeping your face and hair dry.</p>

There are numerous dive sites strewn all over the island. Beginners can start at the shallow side of the ocean, whereas experienced divers can head straight for the more adventurous dive sites such as cliffs, caverns, reefs, pinnacles and wrecks.
One of the most well-known and popular dive sites in Mauritius is the Cathedral, which is located off the Flic en Flac on the western coast of Mauritius. Other famous dive sites in Mauritius include the Whale Rock, the submerged crater near Ile Ronde and the Roche Zozo that is an underwater rock pinnacle.</p>
